# BoFs / Hackathons / Hands-on Sessions -> 12:30 - 13:45

- Jyry Suvilehto, Tommi Jalkanen: **GitLab & GitHub (Diskurssi - 1st Floor)** : The BoF aims to provide an overview of how, when and why github and gitlab version control platforms should be used at CSC. At the beginning there will be an introduction to the different platforms which will be followed by a short hands-on exercise. You will learn how to host your code on github and gitlab, how to organize teamwork using pull requests as well as how to automatically verify your code. We'll also talk about the CSC procedure for using GitLab.
- Aleksi Kallio & Pekka Manninen: **What should we tell to new employess about our computing services? (Titania - 6th floor)** : New employees might not know much about CSC’s computing services when they join, yet using our own services internally and building on top of existing platforms is crucial for streamlining our operations and helps to guide service development. In this BoF session, we will first present the computing infrastructure: what are Sisu, Taito and others, what kind of workloads they are supposed to support. We will also discuss the internal use cases for our computing services and plan how they could be better introduced to new employees. 
- Maria Lehtivaara: **Tell it with tutorial – workshop on how to make simple CSC tutorials and webinars Part 1: How to make a good webinar / tutorial video -Guest trainer: Eeva Kaarne, Kaarne Communication Oy (Debatti - 1st floor)** : You will get ideas how to design and create interesting, easy to follow and clear structured content to webinars and tutorials. You will understand the concept of presentation anxiety and how to cope with it. You will know how to give your presentation some personal touch. This training will help you to present in a relaxed and convincing manner and spark ideas for making better tutorials.
- Markus Koskela: **Neural NLP (Sessio - 7th floor)**: Neural approaches, such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and sequence-to-sequence models have recently attracted great interest in natural language processing. In this session, there will be a short introduction to the topic and then you'll get to try out neural networks for text sentiment analysis and for text categorization. **Remember to bring your laptops**.

### Coffee break

It can be used to host many different types of applications - including scientific applications. The purpose of this BoF is to discuss the different ways in which Rahti could be used to support researchers. One potential result of the discussion could be a list of scientific software suited for hosting in Rahti. At the beginning of the session there will be an introduction to Rahti and a demo from Apurva Nandan showing Spark running in Rahti as an example of a scientific application running in a container cloud.
- Erik Edelmann: **Accounting reports about customer projects and their usage (Titania - 6th floor)** : An overview of REPPU today. Future of REPPU. Discussion: What other usage should we be tracking? How should the data be available?
